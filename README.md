# afcreditscoring
This project implements a decentralized credit scoring model using 100K+ raw transaction-level data from the Aave V2 protocol. The system assigns credit scores ranging from *0 to 1000* to wallets based on behavioral analysis of interactions such as deposit, borrow, repay, and redeem.
