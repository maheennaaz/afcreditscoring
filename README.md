Absolutely! Here's a clean and detailed "How to Run" instruction section that you can paste directly into your README.md file under a heading like ## 🚀 How to Run the Project.

🚀 How to Run the Project

Follow the steps below to set up and execute the full Aave Credit Scoring pipeline on your local machine.


---

🛠 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or above

pip for installing dependencies

(Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:


python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows


---

📦 Step 1: Install Required Libraries

Install the dependencies listed in requirements.txt:

pip install -r requirements.txt

If you don’t have the file, install manually:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

# To run the main file
python main.py 


⚙ Step 2: Run the Pipeline

To execute the full pipeline and generate credit scores:

cd scripts
python main.py

✅ This will:

1. Read the raw data from ../data/aave_raw_data.csv


2. Preprocess it


3. Score each wallet


4. Save final scores to outputs/credit_scores.csv


📊 Step 3: View Score Distribution (Optional)

Open Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

Navigate to:

notebooks/analysis.ipynb

Run all cells to visualize:

Distribution of credit scores

Summary statistics

Behavioral insights



---

✅ Final Output

scripts/outputs/credit_scores.csv: Contains wallet-wise scores (0–1000)

notebooks/analysis.ipynb: Visual analysis

analysis.md: Written insights based on the scores


### 🔹 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/afcreditscoring.git
cd afcreditscoring

🔹 Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

🔹 Add Input Data

Place your raw Aave V2 transaction CSV file in the data/ folder and name it:

aave_raw_data.csv


---

🔄 Pipeline Execution

✅ Step 1: Preprocessing

python preprocessing.py

Cleans nulls, formats timestamps

Extracts wallet-level behavior

Feature engineering (e.g. borrow frequency, repay ratio)


➡ Output: data/processed_data.csv


---

✅ Step 2: Credit Scoring

python scoring.py

Applies custom scoring algorithm:

Repayment consistency

Borrow and redeem patterns

Time-based reliability


Normalizes final score between 0 and 1000


➡ Output: output/final_scored_data.csv


---

✅ Step 3: Visual Insights

jupyter notebook notebooks/analysis.ipynb

Visualizations included:

Distribution of scores

Behavioral comparison by score tier

Repay-to-borrow analysis

Top & bottom wallets



---

🧮 Credit Scoring Logic

Weighted score =

✅ Repayment ratio

📊 Borrow volume and frequency

⏳ Timeliness of repayment

🔁 Redeem pattern

⚖ Volatility or trust score


Final score scaled from 0 to 1000


---

📊 Sample Output

Wallet Address	Total Borrows	Total Repays	Repay Ratio	Score

0xAbc123...	4	4	1.00	920
0xDef456...	5	2	0.40	520
